# UI Performance tests

This folder contains UI performance tests. These make use of the Artillery and Playwright tools to gather metrics from the test executions.

See [Performance UI Tests Repo Docs](https://backstage.internal.certinia.com/docs/default/component/psenterprise-docs/standards/performance-ui-tests/) for more information including how to get started.
